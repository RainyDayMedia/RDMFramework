RDMFramework
============

This is a starter theme based on `_s` but with a few added features for the RDMWorkflow. This is to quickly start client projects with support for child themes. Though `_s` is not meant to be used with a parent/child theme RDM is modifying it to do this. This will be the bases of the future RDMFramework.

<strong>This is an active work in progress</strong>
